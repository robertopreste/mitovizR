## Introduction  

The mitochondrial genome is the circular genomic DNA contained in mitochondria, organelles located in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells.  
In humans, the mitochondrial genome is 16569 bp long, and contains 37 genes, 13 of which are protein-coding genes. Most of the others are tRNA-coding genes, while 2 are rRNA-coding.  

The recent advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing allow a thorough exploration and analysis of mitochondrial variants, which are positions in which nucleotides differ from the reference human mitochondrial genome.
